As organizers and community members, we pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Values

**Civic Tech Toronto relies on the voluntary contributions of the community.**
For us to learn, share, and work together, members and their contributions must be recognized and respected.

**We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.**
Just as you enjoy the freedom to participate, everyone else should enjoy freedom from harassment of any kind. We share stewardship of this space!

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting


## How can I report an issue?
Reach out in person or on Slack to one of the Code of Conduct Committee members to learn more about the process. They will share information that can help you decide whether to file a formal report.

Current members of the Code of Conduct Committee are:

## Outcome Guidelines

Code of Conduct Committee members will follow these Outcome Guidelines, to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:


| Outcome | Community Impact | Consequence |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Correction | Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. | A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested. |
| Warning | A violation through a single incident or series of actions. | A warning with consequences for continued behaviour. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. |
| Temporary Ban | A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour. | A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban. |
| Permanent Ban | Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behaviour, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. | A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. |

## Who does this apply to?

This Code of Conduct applies to all co-organizers, members, sponsors, or other individuals in all CTTO community spaces. This includes all in-person and virtual events or meetings, our Slack channel, and other social media channels. It also applies when an individual is officially representing CTTO in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include posting via an official social media account or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential with details shared only with the Code of Conduct Committee members. In the case that a CoC committee member is involved in a report, the member will be asked to recuse themselves from ongoing conversations, and they will not have access to reports after the enforcement decision has been made. Resolution action may also include removal of that member from the CoC committee. Reporters can withdraw their report at any time.
