## Get Involved 

There are several ways you can get involved in Civic Tech TO.

### Attend our weekly hacknights

The easiest way to get involved is to come out to one of our weekly hacknights! We meet every Tuesday from 6:30pm to 9pm. We start off with a presentation and Q&A from a person or organization doing interesting civic tech work. We then split into breakout groups to work on our various civic tech projects.  Afterwards we usually go for drinks at a nearby bar. The venue changes every month so the best way to keep up to date about our events is by joining our Meetup group at https://www.meetup.com/Civic-Tech-Toronto.

### Become a volunteer organizer

Civic Tech TO is an unincorporated organization and completely volunteer-run — we are always looking for more volunteers to help us keep the weekly hacknights running smoothly. The organizers committee meets once a month where we sign up for a monthly hacknight role, such as maintaining our online presence, taking care of AV, greeting the speaker, or liaising with the venue. If you’re interested in volunteering, send us a message at hi@civictech.ca or speak to any of the [current organizers](https://civictech.ca/about-us/organizers/) at a hacknight.

### Speak at one of our events

If you’re interested in presenting at one of our hacknights, get in touch with us at hi@civictech.ca to set up a chat. We usually book speakers about one month in advance. Take a look at our [Past Hacknights](https://civictech.ca/updates/) to get an idea of what our previous speakers have talked about.

### Provide a venue

Our hacknights switch venues on a monthly basis. The venues need to be able to accommodate approximately 80 people and have adequate AV equipment (projector and microphone). Our venue sponsors typically also sponsor the dinner, which is usually pizza. If your organization would be interested in hosting a month of Civic Tech hacknights, please contact us at hi@civictech.ca.
