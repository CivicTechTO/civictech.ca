description: I used ChatGPT to train a custom bot using open Parks and Rec data --
  facilities, locations, programming, hours of operation -- to train a custom Toronto
  Parks and Rec Bot. Ask it a question, like "I have two kids, 5 and 12, and I want
  them to both take swimming on Saturdays" and get help finding the right classes.
