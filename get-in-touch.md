## Slack

[Join the Slack!](http://link.civictech.ca/slack)

Since moving online in Spring 2020, the Civic Tech Toronto Slack has been a central location for Civic Tech-related communication. If youâ€™re new to Slack, and have any questions:

- This helpful [How-To](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/resources/using-slack/how-to-use-slack&sa=D&ust=1606339707247000&usg=AOvVaw0fDep63jVIk6kjyRxQQEr3) is a great place to start.
- Every week we have a Slack walkthrough as part of Civic Tech 101 after the speaker.
- Reach out to co-organizers at our weekly hacknights, or email us at [hi@civictech.ca](mailto:hi@civictech.ca)
